# Network_Graph
Done for a Data Visualization project. An R script that runs on a list of baby names, genders and ethnicities in New York City, and creates a network to find the most popular names across ethnicities. Saves the plot to a jpeg.

Note: Final plot doesn't have a legend. This is due to a formatting issue in R, that doesn't allow to make a legend that won't cover the network. There is a jpeg saved in the folder with the correct legend.
